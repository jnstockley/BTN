# [BTTN (Better Twitch.tv Notifications)](https://github.com/jnstockley/BTTN)
   This is a Java program that uses [Twitch's API](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/) to determine if a channel is live. The user can add any number of channels, using the program, to a JSON 'config' file. Whenever the program is run it will use the Twitch API to determine if the channel is live. If the status of the channel has changed from not live to live, using data stored in the JSON file, it will send the user a mobile push notification using [Spontit](https://spontit.com). I felt the need to build such a program since I started to get annoyed at how delayed the 1st party Twitch notifications could be, especially for channels with large followers. I would miss the beginning of streams and join late with a feeling that I missed a lot of important content. This program can send a notification within a minute of the stream going live, depending on how many channels are being checked, as compared to Twitch's notification which could be delayed as long as 10+ minutes.
